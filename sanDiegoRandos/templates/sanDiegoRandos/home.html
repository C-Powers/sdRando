    Welcome to <strong>San Diego Randonneurs</strong>, a cycling group dedicated to randonneuring, which is a form of long-distance, self-supported, endurance cycling.
    This style of riding is non-competitive in nature, and self-sufficiency is paramount.
    When riders participate in randonneuring events, they are part of a long tradition that goes back to the beginnings of the sport of cycling in France and Italy.
    Friendly camaraderie, not competition, is the hallmark of randonneuring.
